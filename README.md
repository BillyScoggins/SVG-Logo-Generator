# SVG-Logo-Generator

##This application is designed for the user to be able to create a logo with several options for color, shape, and text.

My motivation for building this was to allow users to be able to to create simple logos for whatever need they may have.

I built this application to allow users access to a simple way to create a logo.

This application allows people to create their own logo as opposed to having to hire a company to create it at a great expense.

This project taught me more using the terminal as a means of creating applications for users.
